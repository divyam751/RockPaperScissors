# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This project is a Rock Paper Scissors game built for practicing JavaScript concepts. It features a simple and interactive user interface designed with HTML and styled using CSS. The game logic is implemented in JavaScript, showcasing fundamental concepts such as event handling, conditional statements, and DOM manipulation.

## Features

- **User Interaction**: Click on the images of Rock, Paper, or Scissors to make your move.
- **Random Computer Choice**: The computer randomly selects its move after the user makes a choice.
- **Result Display**: The game displays the result of each round and updates the scores accordingly.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is designed to be responsive, with adjusted styling for different screen sizes.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the game.
- **CSS**: Styles the game for an engaging user experience.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the game logic, handling user input, and updating the DOM dynamically.

## JavaScript Concepts Used

1. **Event Handling**: Utilizing the `addEventListener` method to capture user clicks on the Rock, Paper, and Scissors elements.

2. **Conditional Statements**: Implementing conditional statements to determine the winner of each round based on user and computer choices.

3. **DOM Manipulation**: Dynamically updating the HTML elements to reflect the game's state, including scores and result messages.

4. **Random Number Generation**: Generating a random index to simulate the computer's choice from the array of options (Rock, Paper, Scissors).

5. **Responsive Design**: Incorporating media queries to adjust the styling for a better user experience on different devices.
